## Librarys

**State management:** 

 I used **REDUX** because it is the library I know best for state management.
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux
- redux-thunk

**Navigation:** 

Although I have not used **react-navigation** in my job, I have used it some times for my projects and I feel comfortable using it
- @react-navigation/native
- @react-navigation/native-stack
- react-native-safe-area-context
- react-native-screens

**XML**

I have had to use it to parse the xml object
- fast-xml-parser

**Data**

Used for fetching data
- react-query

Used for caching data
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

## Design patterns

My work methodology is to make the files as reusable as possible. For this the files have to have a single use. If a component has more than one utility, for me the best way is to split it into as many components as utilities.

For that reason in my test I have tried that the screens have the minimum utility and that these are constructed based on the different components that are needed to make the app run.
