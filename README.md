## Design patterns

My work methodology is to make the files as reusable as possible. For this the files have to have a single use. If a component has more than one utility, for me the best way is to split it into as many components as utilities.

For that reason in my test I have tried that the screens have the minimum utility and that these are constructed based on the different components that are needed to make the app run.
